# ATAG - Automated Test Automation Generation

A black-box test generation framework for test libraries. ATAG employs machine learning algorithms to construct test cases based on testing goals specified by the user. This version, created for a master's thesis, is currently in the prototype phase. Instructions will be updated at a later time.

Implementations ready for test generation:
- Vanilla Policy Gradient (PG)
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Online Decision Transformer (ODT)
